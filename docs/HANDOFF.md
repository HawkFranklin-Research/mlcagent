# Handoff — 6 October 2026

The coding request authorized the complete P0–P8 source implementation and local phase commits.
The user explicitly deferred tests, smoke/full-cycle runs and live model calls. The anemia dataset is
on another machine and will be provided later. Test sources/fixtures were also deferred; do not claim
acceptance-check completion.

Read README.md, IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md, DECISIONS.md and security-model.md before continuing.
The original plan.md is preserved. No reference code was copied. License and image-logo choices are
pending. Both workflow templates are DRAFT and need author scientific review.

Key locations: src/mlca/api.py (front-end contract), log/ (durable records and pure state), engine/
(gates/options/scope/facts/turns/split), runner/ and sandbox/ (execution, reproduction and test access),
llm/ (providers/request evidence), project/ (init/env/views), report/, tui/, src/mlca_runtime/.

Static lint/format checks pass. The tool environment is .venv, dependencies are locked with uv.lock.
No model/provider is configured automatically. Package installation is complete; no CLI launch was used
as a smoke check. No remote or publication has been configured. The paper and legacy/reference folders
were not edited.

When validation is authorized, begin with offline invariant/contract tests and synthetic data, then
CLI/Textual smoke runs, bubblewrap mount checks and a fake-provider complete cycle. Inspect unsupported
host namespaces, library import/audit interactions and report reproducibility before scientific runs.
Then obtain the anemia dataset and exact model/provider settings for explicit live studies.
P9 still needs separate authorization.
